How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

it is easy because you diff show exactly what was changend.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

using verion control systems like git,svn ...

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

I think you have to have the responsability of choose what and what time you want commit, so automaticaly way, you can save what you don't want.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

I totaly agree with muiltple files in one commit, some times to fix a bug, we have to changes more then 1 file, so it's make sence commit all together.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

with git log command you will see all commits from the current directoty
with git diff you can compare using commit Ids to show the changes of two versions of commits
