When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  when you want!!!


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	it is safe, and probally you migth have a friend work with you and you don't want make him angry.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	forks exists only in github and do a copy of somebody projet to my github
	clones make a copy of git hub to local machine
	branches are marks that you create in your repository or on githun too.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	the benefit is that you don't will code on a old version of the file

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	with no doubt it would be very hard, may by email
